# The `Academic` LaTeX Class
This is a showcase of a LaTeX document class for academic writing. It implements custom commands and environments, which allow a higher level of abstraction, to speed up writing.

While LaTeX is the indisputable king for typesetting academic papers, it does have a steep learning curve and is very syntax-heavy. To ease the burden of typesetting and bring the focus back on the content, the syntax should be as light as possible - hence this humble project.

Take a look at this example, which also acts as a manual:
| Source                | Result                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| ![p1](figures/s1.png) | ![p1](figures/p1.png) |
| ![p1](figures/s2.png) | ![p2](figures/p2.png) |
| ![p1](figures/s3.png) | ![p3](figures/p3.png) |

It works out-of-the-box with overleaf, but locally, you need to have all package dependencies installed. Check up on the `svg` package, which have non-latex dependencies.

This was made entirely for my own workflow, and I do not intend to maintain or fix issues in the future. Do with it, as you please.

## Changelog:
- Replaced `minted` with `listings` to remove dependency on Pygmentize.
